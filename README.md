# Bikesharing

## Overview of our analysis

The purpose of this of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. For this analysis, we use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we create a set of visualizations to:

 - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
 - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
 - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, we added these new visualizations to the two we created in the module for the final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results

To see all of our visualizations, please use the link below:

Upon our analysis, we identified the following key statistics: 

 - The majority of bike trips were under 20 minutes, rarely fo past an hour. 
 - The trip duration pattern is similar across all genders.
 - Bikes are mostly rented during weekdays, more specifically during commuting times. 
 - Highest activity hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM and require the most resources mobilized.
 - The activity from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM is low so this would be the window for bike maintenance.
 - Male users should be the atrget market as they take approximately 3 times more rides than the female users.
 - 19% of these rides were used by customers and 81% were used by subscribers.

## Summary

In conclusion, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.

If I were to pursue additional lines of inquiry for analysis and visualization, given the data provided, I would explore:

 - The trip starting and ending locations during morning and evening rush hour time-windows, to display the flow of traffic between neighborhoods at peak hours;
 - The average trip duration, by birth year, by gender, to explore if there was any difference in male or female or un-gendered riders as they age.
